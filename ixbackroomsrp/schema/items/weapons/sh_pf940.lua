ITEM.description = "This pistol isn't like the others you've found. It's clean, almost new, and has a custom feel to its tan polymer frame. This isn't a weapon of last resort, it's a badge of authority. The weight feels deliberate in your hand; you know this weapon was a companion until it was dropped, or you took it. It's a clean slate with a dangerous history."
