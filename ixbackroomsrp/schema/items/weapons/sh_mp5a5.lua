ITEM.description = "The MP5 is an oddity. It's too sleek and well-made to be a common find, and it lacks the weathered age of the other guns you've come across. It sits in your hands like an extension of your arm, its weight perfectly balanced. It's not a prized trophy, but it's a weapon you know you can rely on."
